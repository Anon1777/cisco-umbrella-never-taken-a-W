SOW:
* I will turn the "add_sample_data()" function into a command-line function.

EOW:
* I was unable to convert add_sample_data() into a command-line function because of marching band camp and various errors raised by seemingly perfect code.

Challenges:
* I kept getting a "database is locked" error, which I am not sure if I was able to resolve
* After SQLAlchemy was imported, I had major issues installing it, including a runtime error that could not be solved.

Communication:
* I talked with my peers about my conflicts.
