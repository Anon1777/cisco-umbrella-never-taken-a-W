SOW:
* I will work on making the shooters page as intended in the mockup.
* I will use data for the report on screen.

EOW:
* I worked on the shooters page and made it look as intended in the mockup.
* I fixed an error on the macro.html page.

Challenges:
* My computer was not cooperating at all. When I loaded it up, it would run at 100% CPU rendering it impossible to get any work done.
* I tried moving files from my computer to a separate hard drive and it has been working better, but by then I was unable to reunderstand the instructions of the project.
* I had rewatched the lesson and still was unable to figure what I was supposed to do.
* After communicating with my team, I tried to make the page look correct, but I kept finding an error.

Communication:
* Due to my computer being unable to load, I was unable to access Slack. In hindsight, I should have downloaded Slack on my phone.
* After my computer started working again, I contacted my mentor and clarified the instructions with him.
