SOW:
* I will fix the tables showing up regardless of scores posted or not.
* I will finish the Module 3 documentation.

EOW:
* I fixed the tables so that they will only show up if there are scores in the database.
* I worked on and finished the Module 3 documentation.

Challenges:
* I had trouble modeling the documentation, so I wrote what I thought was necessary and checked it against other documentation examples.

Communication:
* I thought I had run into an error fixing the tables, so I asked my mentor if it looked correct and he confirmed that it was right.
